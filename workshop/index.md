# Welcome!

Hello everyone, and welcome to the Setup Page for the Focus Workshop on Data Management for the OS Days Marburg 2024! We're glad to have you here.

On these pages, we provide information on how to install everything necessary for the workshop and refresh or acquire the essential skills you'll need.

You might feel that this is a lot to set up for a simple 90-minute workshop, but the provided setup is designed to be your go-to resource for everyday data management needs. The tools introduced are primarily intended for working with large datasets, but the version control and data provenance capabilities they offer will be invaluable for every project you undertake.

If you’d rather download these materials, you can do so via the {download} symbol at the top of the respective page. You can open the respective content (.ipynb or .md files) via an IDE (e.g. VScode, Atom) or via Jupyter Notebooks/Lab.

## Prerequisites

These resources are primarily for your self-study and to provide a complete framework. Take a moment to go through the material and ensure you at least understand what bash and a terminal or command-line interface are. Everything else is either "good to know" (read: invaluable for any data scientist or neuroscientist) or will be addressed during the workshop as needed.

We encourage you to value your time and effort—feel free to revisit our materials (or search online,- we will never know) if there's something you don't understand or need a quick refresher in the future.

## I've got a question!

In case you have any questions or difficulties going through the workshop, please don’t hesitate a single second to get in touch with
us. A great way to do this is via e-mail @ Ernst@psych.uni-frankfurt.de.
